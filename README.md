# Solver for Systems of Linear Equations using Gauss Elimination Method (without pivoting)

## Overview
This C++ project provides a program to solve systems of linear equations in the form Ax=b using the Gauss elimination method without pivoting.

## Features
- Reads input data from a CSV file.
- Performs Gaussian elimination on the input matrix.
- Displays the solutions to the system of equations.

## How to Use
1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable, providing the path to the input CSV file as a command-line argument.
3. The program will display the augmented matrix, perform Gaussian elimination, and output the solutions to the system of equations.
